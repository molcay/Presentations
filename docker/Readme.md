## Docker CLI Commands
List of some basic command of docker cli.

### TLDR;
```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu

$ docker run -p 3306:3306 \
             -v $(pwd)/mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
             -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=toor \
             -e MYSQL_DATABASE=SpringTEST \
             -e MYSQL_USER=test_user \
             -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=root \
             -d \
             --name mysql_for_spring \
             mysql

$ docker ps

$ docker exec -it ubuntu bash

$ docker inspect mysql_for_spring # get detailed information for the container

$ docker stop mysql_for_spring # you can use container id instead of container name (mysql_for_spring)
$ docker start mysql_for_spring
$ docker restart mysql_for_spring

$ docker rm mysql_for_spring # for containers
$ docker rmi mysql # for images

$ docker images # list images
$ docker container ls # list containers
```

* to get a new image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
  ```bash
  docker pull ubuntu
  ```

---

### Detailed List

* to run an image
  ```bash
  docker run redis
  ```
  > if the image is not exist on your computer, docker pull it first and run after that.

    - if the image is run an attachable program, then the command block the terminal (attach mode). You can bypass this with `-d` parameter.
    ```bash
    docker run -d elasticsearch:5-alpine
    ```
    - if an image expose a port and you want to use that port, you need to expose it.
      ```bash
      docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
      ```
      > the previous command run an `nginx` image and `publish` (`-p` stands for), container's 80 port to host machine 8080 port.

    - you can set a container name with `docker run` command
      ```bash
      docker run -p 9042:9042 --name mycassandra cassandra
      ```
      > this command create a docker container and name it as `mycassandra`. at any point in time you can _**start**_, _**stop**_, _**restart**_ the container with name. If you omit `--name` parameter docker set a random 2-word name to a container.
    
    - you can bind volumes(mount a path from host to a container's path) with `docker run`
      ```bash
      docker run -v <PATH_TO_HOST_FOLDER>:<PATH_TO_CONTAINER_FOLDER> ubuntu
      ```
      > `<PATH_TO_HOST_FOLDER>` and `<PATH_TO_CONTAINER_FOLDER>`Â needs to be absolute path of the folder. You can use `$(pwd)` to get current working dir for `<PATH_TO_HOST_FOLDER>`, or `$HOME` get your user's home dir
    
    - you can pass an environment variable to image (actually container)
      ```bash
      docker -e VAR1=value1 ubuntu
      ```

> NOTE: when an image runs, you will get a container.

---

* to list all running container
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

---

* to run a `command` in a running container
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> <COMMAND>
  # <CONTAINER_ID> is the ID of container. you can obtain it `docker ps` command.
  # <COMMAND> is can be any command that is valid for the container.
  # !!! CAUTION: every linux distribution does not have `bash` installed. You can use `sh` instead.
  ```
    - `-i`: Keep STDIN open even if not attached
    - `-t`: Allocate a pseudo-TTY
    - TLDR; with `-it` parameters you can interact with container' TTY with enable coloring output.
    > you can use container's name instead of `<CONTAINER_ID>`

    > Its enough to pass first 3 char of <CONTAINER_ID> as argument.

* to run image and immediately execute command in the container
  ```bash
  docker run -it ubuntu sh # ubuntu: <IMAGE_NAME>, sh: <COMMAND>
  ```

---

* to stop/start/restart a container
  ```bash
  docker <ACTION> <CONTAINER_ID> # <ACTION> can be stop, start, restart
  ```
  > you can use container's name instead of `<CONTAINER_ID>`

---

* to remove container
  ```bash
  docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
  ```
  > you can use container's name instead of `<CONTAINER_ID>`

* to remove image
  ```bash
  docker rmi <IMAGE_NAME>
  ```
  > you can use container's name instead of `<CONTAINER_ID>`
